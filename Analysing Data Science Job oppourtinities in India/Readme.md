# Analysing Data Science Job oppourtinities in India.
## Are you looking for a career transition to data science? Looking for a job in data science? This project can help you.ðŸ˜ƒ

### In this project I have done the following tasks: 
* Scrapped data from the top job hunt website in India- > Naukri.com, which almost every job aspirant uses these days. Selenium-python is been used for web scraping.
* Created a notebook where I did some feature engineering & plotted some very useful graphs which can give a very good visualizations regarding the job market for Data science in India.
* These are visualizations every aspiring data scientist in India should have a look at.

### Answers that can be found in my notebook: 

* What are the top skills companies are looking for?
* What is the most desired experience level in the industry?
* What are the companies that are actively offering jobs in this field?
* What are the locations that have more openings?


### Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium.   
You will require google chromedriver also to scrap the data.


### Step 1: Web Scraping
I have used selenium to scrap the data from Naukri.com, which is the best job hunt website in India. Hence the data is real. The data contains following columns:
* Job Roles.
* Company name.
* Experience required.
* Location.
* Key Skills.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our EDA. 

### Step 3: EDA
I plotted some really usefull graphs to look at the job opportunities for Data science in India. Below are a few highlights from the Exploratory Data Analysis.
