# Analyse & Visualize to Explore the VideoGame Data!

## Goal of this project:
The goal of this notebook is to analyse the video game dataset and create some meaningful visualizations. I have tried to use various color patterns provided by seaborn. The dataset seems really good as there are no null values. The feature engineering part was not required atleast for my work.

## Some of the important visualizations in this notebook are:
1. Number of Games made as per Genre type

2. Pie polts to visualize the sales as per regions for the top years.
