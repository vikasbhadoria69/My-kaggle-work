# Explore, Visualize & Predict healthy Avocados.

## In this project I have done the following tasks:
#### 1. Did Feature engineering to round off certain features and created new features like Day & Month.
#### 2. Went in detail to explore and visualize the data. Some important graphs in notebooks are:
* Avg.Price of Avocado by City,Total volume of Avocado sold by City.
* Avg.price of Avocado as per type, AvgPrice of avocado as per days of month, Total volume of avacado sold as per month.
* Pie graph to visualize volume distribution.
#### 3. Used Facebook Prophet to predict the future average price of Avodaco.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, facebook Prophet.

## Some important graphs & visuals from the notebook are:

## Conclusions: 

Conclusion.
I was able to get some really nice visualizations and comparison graphs. I tried to look through the data left, right and centre. The first 2 steps went smooth. But in the last step I was not able to get very accurate predictions using Facebook Prophet. I will try to come back to my project and make changes in last step. Also I would like to try LSTM & ARIMA for my future tasks. It would be nice to compare the results of all 3 then.


#### I have uploaded the notebook also on kaggle, which earned a bronze medal. Find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/vikasbhadoria/explore-visualize-predict-healthy-avocados
